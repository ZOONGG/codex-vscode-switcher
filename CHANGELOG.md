# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added profile status metadata for manual tracking of profile limits and availability.
- Added validated per-profile manual status editing in Settings; metadata remains separate from credentials.
- Added an emoji-only overlay formatter and a deterministic recommendation algorithm for future real provider data.
- Added schema migration, generalized usage windows, UTC/local-time handling, stale-cache preservation, timeout/cancellation, and notification deduplication primitives.
- Added a provider capability gate. Automatic usage retrieval remains disabled because no supported Codex CLI or documented local source was found; no values are fabricated.
- Fixed severe overlay overhead by reusing the attached window, skipping unchanged WPF placement work, containing tracking errors, and avoiding duplicate Codex launches.
- Expanded English/Russian localization and regression coverage for settings, thresholds, recommendations, stale data, and unavailable-provider behavior.

## Previous Releases
