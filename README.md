# Codex Swap Account

**A safe, local Windows account switcher for the Codex desktop app.**

Switch between multiple Codex accounts from an overlay attached directly to the Codex window — with tray controls, global hotkeys, per-account chats/settings, multi-monitor support, and automatic rollback if a switch fails.

## Why this exists

Using several Codex accounts normally means repeatedly signing out, opening a browser, completing authentication, and restarting your workflow.

Codex Swap Account turns that into a one-click action:

1. choose a profile in the overlay, tray menu, or with a hotkey;
2. the app safely saves the current profile state;
3. Codex restarts with the selected account;
4. your real workspace folders stay shared, while Codex chats and session state follow the selected account.

The app runs quietly in the system tray and only shows the overlay when a verified Codex window is available.

## Highlights

| | Feature |
|---|---|
| **Fast switching** | Switch accounts from the overlay, tray menu, or `Ctrl + Alt + 1…9`. |
| **Per-account Codex state** | Switch chats, projects, session history, and local Codex databases with the selected account while keeping real workspace folders in place. |
| **Compact and expanded modes** | Use a minimal dropdown or a one-click segmented profile bar. |
| **Safe transaction** | Back up the active authorization and automatically roll back if switching fails. |
| **Multi-monitor ready** | The overlay follows Codex across monitors, window moves, resizes, and DPI changes. |
| **Local only** | No telemetry, no cloud sync, no reverse proxy, and no credential upload. |
| **Tray companion** | Launch Codex, show/hide the overlay, manage profiles, and change settings from the tray. |
| **Bilingual UI** | English and Russian interface support. |
| **No admin rights** | Runs per-user and does not require a Windows service. |
| **Open source** | Built with C#, .NET 8, WPF, and a security-focused repository workflow. |

## Download

Go to the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ZOONGG/codex-swap-account/releases/latest).

Recommended download:

```text
CodexProfileOverlay-win-x64-portable.zip
```

Standalone executable:

```text
CodexProfileOverlay.exe
```

Integrity hashes:

```text
SHA256SUMS.txt
```

### Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- x64 system
- Codex desktop app
- Codex CLI available in `PATH` when adding a new profile

> [!NOTE]
> Windows SmartScreen may warn about an unsigned executable. This is expected for an independently distributed open-source build. Verify the SHA-256 hash from the release and review/build the source if you prefer.

## Quick start

1. Download `CodexProfileOverlay-win-x64-portable.zip`.
2. Extract the archive to a normal folder.
3. Run `CodexProfileOverlay.exe`.
4. Open Codex.
5. Use **Add profile** to authorize your accounts.
6. Select a profile from the overlay, tray menu, or a hotkey.

The application remains in the system tray. Closing the settings window does not exit the background process.

## Default hotkeys

| Action | Default shortcut |
|---|---|
| Show or hide the overlay | `Ctrl + Alt + C` |
| Switch to profile 1 | `Ctrl + Alt + 1` |
| Switch to profile 2 | `Ctrl + Alt + 2` |
| Switch to profile 3 | `Ctrl + Alt + 3` |
| Switch to profiles 4–9 | `Ctrl + Alt + 4…9` |

Hotkeys can be changed or cleared in **Settings → Hotkeys**. The app reports a conflict when Windows cannot register a shortcut.

## How switching works

Codex normally stores local state under:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\.codex
```

Codex Swap Account keeps the directory location stable, but switches the account-scoped Codex state inside it:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\.codex
├── chats / sessions  ← switched per profile
├── projects          ← switched per profile
├── settings
├── history           ← switched per profile
├── caches
├── databases
└── auth.json         ← switched per profile
```

Saved account profiles are stored separately:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\.codex-profiles
├── Work
│   └── auth.json
├── Personal
│   └── auth.json
└── Backup
    └── auth.json
```

During a switch, the app:

1. prevents concurrent switch operations;
2. closes Codex gracefully;
3. saves the freshly updated `auth.json` and Codex chat/session state back to the active profile;
4. creates a backup of the current authorization and Codex state;
5. atomically replaces `auth.json` with the selected profile;
6. restores the selected profile's saved Codex state, or clears stale shared state for a new profile;
7. records the active profile only after replacement succeeds;
8. launches Codex normally;
9. restores the previous authorization and Codex state if any critical step fails.

The application does **not** switch the entire `.codex` directory. It only switches known account-scoped state files and folders, so real workspace paths are not copied into profiles.

## Adding a profile

The **Add profile** flow:

1. creates a directory under `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-profiles`;
2. creates a profile-local `config.toml` when required;
3. runs `codex login` with `CODEX_HOME` set only for that login process;
4. waits for browser authentication;
5. checks that the profile authorization file exists;
6. adds the profile to the switcher.

The app never displays or logs the credential contents.

## Display modes

### Auto

Uses Expanded mode when enough space is available and Compact mode for narrow Codex windows. Hysteresis prevents mode flickering during resizing.

### Expanded

Shows all profiles as segmented buttons for immediate one-click switching.

### Compact

Shows the active profile in a smaller dropdown with access to profiles and common actions.

The overlay can be positioned after the Codex menu, centered, aligned right, or dragged to a custom location with `Alt + left mouse button`.

## System tray

The tray menu provides:

- Open Codex
- Show or hide the switcher
- Switch profiles
- Open Settings
- Enable or disable Start with Windows
- Exit the application

The tray process stays alive when Codex is closed or minimized and automatically reattaches when Codex becomes available again.

## Privacy and security

Codex Swap Account is designed to operate entirely on the local machine.

- no telemetry;
- no analytics;
- no remote account database;
- no credential upload;
- no browser-cookie export;
- no reverse proxy;
- no Windows service;
- no administrator privileges;
- no parsing, printing, or logging of `auth.json` contents.

Local application data is stored under:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexProfileOverlay
```

This may contain non-secret settings, logs, backups, profile display metadata, and removed-profile backups.

Read the complete security policy in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

> [!WARNING]
> Treat every `auth.json` file like a password. Never share it, attach it to an issue, or commit it to Git.

## Installation options

### Portable

Download the portable ZIP, extract it, and run:

```powershell
.\CodexProfileOverlay.exe
```

### Per-user installation from source

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -Launch
```

Enable Start with Windows during installation:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -StartWithWindows -Launch
```

Default installation location:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexProfileOverlay
```

## Uninstall

From the repository:

```powershell
.\uninstall.ps1
```

The uninstaller removes the application, its shortcuts, and its startup entry. It does **not** remove:

- `%USERPROFILE%\.codex`;
- `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-profiles`;
- Codex chats;
- Codex projects;
- Codex settings;
- Codex history;
- account authorization files.

## Build from source

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 x64
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- .NET 8 SDK

Clone the repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ZOONGG/codex-swap-account.git
cd codex-swap-account
```

Run tests:

```powershell
.\test.ps1
```

Build Release:

```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

Run the repository safety scan:

```powershell
.\verify-repository-safety.ps1
```

Publish the self-contained Windows build:

```powershell

```

Output:

```text
artifacts\publish\CodexProfileOverlay.exe
artifacts\CodexProfileOverlay-win-x64-portable.zip
```

## Troubleshooting

### Codex is not detected

- Make sure the official Codex desktop app is open.
- Restart Codex Swap Account.
- Check the logs under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexProfileOverlay\logs`.
- Verify that Codex can be started normally.

### The overlay is hidden

- Press `Ctrl + Alt + C`.
- Left-click the tray icon.
- Use **Show switcher** from the tray menu.
- Check **Show automatically when Codex opens** in Settings.

### A hotkey does not work

Another application may already own that shortcut. Open **Settings → Hotkeys** and choose a different combination.

### A profile cannot send requests

The stored login may have expired or been revoked. Remove/re-add the local profile or authenticate it again through the Add profile flow.

### Windows SmartScreen blocks the app

Choose **More info → Run anyway** only after downloading from the official repository release and verifying the SHA-256 hash.

## Limitations

- Windows x64 only.
- Switching requires Codex to restart so it can load the selected authorization.
- Adding profiles requires the Codex CLI.
- The current installer is a per-user PowerShell installer rather than MSI/MSIX.
- The application depends on window/process metadata available to a normal Windows user process.
